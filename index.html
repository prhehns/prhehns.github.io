                <br>
                <p><strong>It is important to pick your track so that you will not waste money and time.</strong> In picking <strong>Be sure of your personality and life goals</strong> so to match your taste and experience. <strong>Research and Analyze the subject included in each course</strong>                    to help you make your choice. <strong>Check schools nearby that offer your choosen track</strong> once you’ve set your mind, find out schools nearby that offer the program. Schools in the Philippines adopted the SHS program since 2016,
                    so you need not look far to find the right one for you.
                    <br>
                    <br> Students get support from DepEd through vouchers for JHS finishers to help them enroll in the most ideal senior high school track. These checks, though, are usable even in specialty schools as long as they adhere to the senior
                    high school curriculum required by the government. As a result, SHS students relish in the opportunity to pursue innovative courses such as animation and ICT, which were otherwise non-existent in the old curriculum.
